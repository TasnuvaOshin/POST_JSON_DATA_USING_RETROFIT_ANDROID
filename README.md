# POST_JSON_DATA_USING_RETROFIT_ANDROID
Post json data using Retrofit Library Android Studio . Very Easy And Simple.



1st of all add this two dependency 

//retrofit for getting retrofit client 
//gson for getting POJO

And In your Manifest write Internet Permission
 
 implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.5.0'
 implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.4.0'

There are Free API For You Now:

httpbin.org/post

base ur = http://httpbin.org
And In interface  -@post("/post")

{For Checking Purpose Use Postman . So that you can understand better how this api works}
here will get a json response what you post **use this api for test purpose
at go the retrofit connection package {folder}

you will get a class mane RetrofitConnection - which is the main class for 
making a Retrofit Object and get Instance and by this instance we will build the system.
for this we need base url . which we define there check that out. 

Get all information under the main files . so check out now .

and we need to data set (one is DataSet which is mainly for post request)
and there we create a intanse of Json class Json json which is for response data.
as the response data is also so we need to create another class Json json .
